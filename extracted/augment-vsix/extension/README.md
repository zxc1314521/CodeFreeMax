### Get up to speed

Find out how a system works, investigate a bug, or learn to use a new API. Whether you’ve been in a codebase from the first commit or are onboarding to a new team, Augment orients you in minutes even if you’re new to a project or working in an unfamiliar part of the codebase.

### Make updates with confidence

There are no simple changes in production-grade software, but Augment manages the challenges for you. Agent, Next Edit, and code completions automatically understand your code, APIs, schemas, and dependencies so you have everything you need at your fingertips.

## Powerful AI for the way you code

#### Agent powered engineering

Complete tasks, build features, and solve production problems with an agent that knows you and your codebase best. Expand Agent's powers when you use Augment's native integrations or access 100+ tools with MCP.

#### Intelligent Chat with deep integrations

Get instant answers, plan a project, and define changes through Chat. Then use _Smart Apply_ to intelligently update your code in one click.

#### Next Edit

Even simple changes ripple throughout a codebase. Next Edit gives turn-by-turn directions that makes edits across your code, tests, and docs.

#### Instructions using natural language

Instructions let you add or modify code with natural language prompts directly in your open editor–from simple edits to tendious refactors.

#### Code completions

Lightning fast, codebase aware suggestions as you type, tailored to your project's structure, dependencies, and style.
